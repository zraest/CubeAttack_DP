# Cube Distinguisher Extraction using Division Property in Block Ciphers

Automatic tools for finding distinguishers simplify the attacks. Here, we extend and adapt [Solvatore](https://github.com/kste/solvatore) to find cube distinguishers for block ciphers in a non-blackbox manner and apply it to block cipher KATAN32.

## Running the tests

python katan32_test.py
